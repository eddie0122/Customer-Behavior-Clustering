# Customer Behavior Clustering
* This is an example of customer behavior clustering based on mobile log behaviors
<br/>
<br/>
## The Purpose of Clustering
1. Identifying customers' traits from mobile log behaviors
2. Making clusters of customers who have similar traits of mobile log behaviors
<br/>
<br/>
## How to Clustering
1. Establish pivoting dataset - Customers IDs (Rows) x Mobile log behaviors Codes (Columns)
2. Calculate Cosine Similarity(Distance) among customers
3. Split customers into 7 clusters
4. Find centroids of 7 clusters
